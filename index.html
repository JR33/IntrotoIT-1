	<h1>  Personal information <h1>
    <p>My name is Joshua Renshaw, I am 18, and from London, England. My dad’s family is from the UK and my mum’s family is from Finland, and as a result I speak fluent Finnish. I attended the majority of primary school and the entirety of high school in Melbourne, Australia. I enjoy video games, particularly rocket league, soccer, cricket and chess.<p>
	
	<h1> Interest in IT <h1>
	<h2> What is your interest in IT and where did it start? <h2>
	<p> My interest in IT is basically anything concerning technology, but particularly network technology (servers, switches, routers, etc) and general consumer computers. I also have a fascination with chess engines as a result of being an avid, if not particularly proficient chess player, which has led to an interest in machine learning and neural net computing technologies, as used by chess engines. My interest in IT started when I was given an old HP pavilion laptop from a friend, to play video games on, and I quickly determined that I wanted a more powerful computer, however I didn’t have the faintest idea of where to start on getting one. So I decided to learn, and have since then not only built myself a powerful desktop, but also taken a computing class in high school, which began my interest in networking hardware, and successfully added multiple access points to my home network, to increase its usability. <p>
	
	<h2> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? <h2>
	<p> I chose to study IT at RMIT because well it is called the institute of technology, so I assumed that I could probably learn a thing or two about technology there, which was my goal. Outside of that, RMIT has an excellent reputation as being a good place to study IT. Additionally the location of RMIT’s City campus is convenient for me.<p>
	
	<h2> What do you expect to learn during your studies? <h2>
	<p> Basically whatever I can. I find almost every aspect of technology (except printers) to be interesting and exciting in both the way it works and its applications, and as a result I just want to know as much as I can about it. <p>

	<h2> Description <h2>
	<p> This job is setting up networks in schools, which is a particular interest of mine. It's about designing the best possible networking solution, to fit a specific space and then testing to make sure that it works. I am interested in networking technology partly out of convenience, as I discovered that setting up access points at home improved my ability to access the internet. However this then led to further research into how networking technology works, which became very interesting to me, and I would enjoy doing this kind of thing full time. <p>
	
	<h2> Skills, qualifications, experience <h2>
	<p> In depth knowledge of Microsoft Windows Server products, a good understanding of network infrastructure, a good understanding of active directory domains, DHCP, DNS, Hyper-V, VMware and group policy, excellent knowledge and experience with operating systems, Microsoft Office and tablet devices, experience with Office 365 and google apps for education, good communication and documentation skills, excellent time management skills and ability to prioritize tasks, valid driver's license. <p>

	<h1> Personal profile <h1>
	<a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/"> <h2>Myers-Briggs test<h2></a>
	<img src = mbt.jpg alt="Myers-Briggs result">
	<p>The results of this test say that I am introverted, which is definitely true, and that I like to learn things in a hands on style. The website suggests people like me are often mechanics and engineers, which would account for my interest in cars, and the hardware side of IT. <p>
	
	<a href = "http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/"> <h2>Online learning styles test<h2> </a>
	<img src = olst.jpg alt="Online learning styles result">
	<p> The results of this test suggest that I learn best by collecting and analysing information to reach conclusions, which are often affected by my own past experiences and ideas. <p>
	
	<a href = "https://openpsychometrics.org/"> <h2>Big 5 personality test<h2> </a>
	<img src = b5pt.jpg alt = "Big 5 personality result">
	<p> This test suggests that I am not a particularly sociable person, and I am a person who relies on my intellect and imagination to determine the value of my experiences. <p>
	
	<h2> What do the results of these tests mean to me? <h2>
	<p> The results of these tests confirm what I already know. I don’t particularly like other people and I am a logical, hands on person. <p>
	
	<h2> How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team? <h2>
	<p> These results show that I am not a very sociable person, and therefore would not be particularly communicative to my team members. <p>
	
	<h2> How should I take this into account when forming a team? <h2>
	<p> I should take this into account by making an effort to be more communicative and sociable when working in a group, and it would also help if the group had someone in it who is naturally sociable, to make sure that group communication flows easily. <p>
	
	<h1> Project idea <h1>
	
	<h2> Overview <h2>
	<p> My project idea is to expand the copy and paste functions in Microsoft Windows. If you copy something in Windows, it is saved to your clipboard, allowing you to copy multiple things and then paste them when you need to. However this solution requires users to memorise the keyboard shortcut of WIN+V, which not many people are aware of. However most people are aware that CTRL+C is copy and CTRL+V is paste, so my idea is to simply expand these keyboard shortcuts and simply use CTRL+C+number/CTRL+V+number to allow the user to copy and paste up to 9 things at any given time. <p>
	
	<h2> Motivation <h2>
	<p> My motivation for this is that I often want to copy and paste multiple different things in a short span of time, however I find that the clipboard system is obscure and not particularly nice to use, as it requires using the mouse to select what you want to paste. I think that my solution is easier to learn and use, and will help many people with copying and pasting things in productivity applications. Considering that there are over 1 billion Windows 10 users (Microsoft 2021), the user base for a service like this is definitely there, even if it is not adopted by anyone. <p>
	
	<h2> Description <h2>
	<p>My aim with this project is to create a program that will allow the user to copy text, images or files to presets, using CTRL+C+number. They will then be able to paste from these presets using CTRL+V+number, where pressing CTRL+V+5 will paste the thing that the user copied to CTRL+C+5, and the same for all other numbers between 1-9 inclusive.. However I do not intend for this program to interfere with regular usage of CTRL+C and CTRL+V as copying and pasting the most recent thing, as changing that would not be conducive to a good user experience. Additionally variations to CTRL+C/CTRL+V, such as CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste without formatting will still work with the presets, for example pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V+5 will paste the 5th preset without formatting it. Furthermore, the user will have the ability to set permanent presets, to store things that they may want to paste often. These permanent presets will not be restricted to only number keys, for example the user could set something to be pasted in upon pressing CTRL+V+L, or any other key of their choice, other than the number keys, which will be used for the regular presets. The variations of copy and paste commands will also apply to permanent presets. <br> <br> Additionally, the program will make use of a small display window listing what is copied to which preset, ensuring that the user does not have to remember themselves. This display will be optional if the user does not want to use it, and will not display permanent presets. I also plan on improving on Windows’ regular paste function, where you cannot simply paste an image from the clipboard to a file. My program will allow images to be pasted straight from a preset to a file, instead of having to paste it into a document to make the image a file. The file type of the pasted image will be configurable by the user, with the default file type being .JPG. This particular part of the program is to solve the issue I often have with trying to turn images from Windows’ snipping tool into files. <br> <br> This program will also include an option to have it open on startup, allowing the user to always use the expanded copy and paste features it offers, or allowing the user to not have it open most of the time and only open it when it is specifically needed for the users use case. It will be written in python and then converted into an executable file, to ensure that the user does not need to download a python compiler to run the program. This program will also work with all other programs, unless there are unresolveable issues that prevent this, allowing the user to take advantage of the increased copy and paste functionality regardless of their use case. This program should allow for productivity increases across many applications, provided that it comes to fruition. <p>
	
	<h2> Tools and technologies <h2>
	<p> To achieve the goal of this project, a computer running Microsoft Windows will be necessary, both to write the program on and to then test it. Additionally, as the program will be written in python (the only programming language I have experience with) a python editor will be required, in this case I plan to use Notepad ++ (Notepad++), and a python compiler will be used to convert the program to an executable, in this case cx_Freeze (cx_Freeze 2020). Furthermore other commonly used programs may be used to test that this copy and paste program works universally. These programs will be credited if/when this project is completed and shall form the basis for a probable compatibility list. <p>
	
	<h2> Skill required <h2>
	<p> To complete this project, knowledge of python is required, to write the software. I am learning python, however it is unlikely that I will be able to write this program with my current level of knowledge, and therefore would have to learn more. However I believe that I can learn enough to at least write a basic version of this program in the near future. Therefore I think that it is feasible that this project will be eventually successfully completed. Additionally, the ability to design and implement a testing method for the software will be required, and as I have had some experience testing software, I believe that I can feasibly achieve this. <p>
	
	<h2> Outcome <h2>
	<p> If this project is successful, it will make copying and pasting in Windows more useful, as the user will be able to store multiple things to use later. This would particularly help in applications like programming, where the user may need to paste multiple bits of code many times. Furthermore, the ability to set custom presets would help in applications that use databases, such as finance tracking, as interest rates, or other numbers that may need to be entered into multiple forms can be saved as presets and pasted in whenever necessary. I believe that this program will improve productivity in a number of areas, and will make Windows more useful for casual users. <p>
